## Overview<a name = "overview"></a>

For this project, we had to develop an application with a Natural User Interface where we are given creative freedom to choose whatever programming language and technology we wish to use to create our application. This project must be a gesture controlled application in which we were given the option of using either the Myo Armband or the Leap Motion Sensor as our form of technology.

The concept our my game is to recreate my very own version of old arcade game 'Space Invaders' using the programming language 'Java'.

I decided to go with the Myo Armband as it's use of pre-determined gestures coincided greatly with the concept of my application. "Rather than using special cameras that sense motion and depth, startup Thalmic Labs' Myo armband detects a wearer's movements and translates them into computer controls. After slipping the Myo armband on your forearm, its sensors begin reading electrical activity in your muscles".

This application also incorporates the use of voice commands which I also learned in the duration of this course, the user can control when the game starts, when the game can be paused and resumed, and when the game is reset just by the sound of their voice. The actions of our player can be controlled manually using the keyboard or by using the Myo Armband.
